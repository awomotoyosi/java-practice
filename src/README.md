# Java Practice Projects
This repository contains my personal Java practice projects. Each task demonstrates different Java concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), collections, data structures, and problem-solving. These are small practice exercises, so the code may not be perfect, but they illustrate my learning and programming ability.
## Project Structure
All files are located in `src/test/java` and organized into packages based on the task. Each file contains its own `main` method for demonstration.
### 1. Bank System (`bank_system`)
**File:** `Bank.java`
**Description:** Implements a simple banking system with `Bank` and `Customer` classes.
**Features:**
Create customers and accounts
Deposit and withdraw money
Demonstrates basic OOP concepts
**Note:** The `main` method is inside `Bank.java` for running examples.
### 2. Music Platform / Playlist (`playlist_manager`)
**File:** `Album.java`
**Description:** Models a mini music streaming platform.
**Features:**
`Album` class stores songs
Playlists can be created and songs added by track number or title
Demonstrates OOP, inner classes, and use of `LinkedList`
**Note:** The `main` method is inside `Album.java`.
### 3. Travel Itinerary (`travel_itinerary`)
**File:** `Places.java`
**Description:** Manages a travel route using a LinkedList.
**Features:**
Stores places with names and distances
Prevents duplicates and keeps places sorted
Allows forward/backward navigation of the itinerary via console input
Demonstrates `LinkedList`, `ListIterator`, and Java records
**Note:** The `main` method is inside `Places.java`.
### 4. Task / Todo List (`todo_manager`)
**File:** `Task.java`
**Description:** Simple task management system with `Task` and `TodoList` classes.
**Features:**
Add, find, and remove tasks
Mark tasks as complete
Print all tasks
Demonstrates OOP, ArrayList, and `LocalDateTime`
**Note:** The `main` method is inside `Task.java`.
## How to Run
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
Navigate to the file for the task you want to run.
Right-click the file and select **Run**.
Follow any instructions in the console if applicable (e.g., for Places navigation).
## Notes
These are **practice projects** meant to demonstrate learning and understanding of Java fundamentals.
Some code may contain warnings or minor issues — they are part of the learning process.
Each file is self-contained and can be run independently.
